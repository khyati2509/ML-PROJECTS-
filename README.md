# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project focuses on customer segmentation for a mall using unsupervised machine learning, specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers based on their spending score and annual income to help businesses understand customer behavior, target marketing strategies, and improve decision-making.
Through data analytics and visual exploration, we identify distinct customer segments that can inform business insights like which customers are high spenders or value seekers.
Skills & Concepts Demonstrated:
Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised ML)
Data Analytics: Data cleaning, EDA, feature analysis
Business Analytics: Customer profiling and behavior analysis
üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for ML modeling (KMeans)
