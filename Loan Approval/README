Loan Approval Prediction System – A machine learning model that predicts loan approval based on applicant details and is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app with a user-friendly UI.
✅ Technical Skills Demonstrated
Machine Learning (ML)
Built and trained a predictive Loan Approval Model.
Worked with classification algorithms (probably Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest / etc. from the notebook).
Evaluated performance with metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).
Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
Used scaling/normalization (scaler.pkl) for model consistency.
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Graduated/Not Graduated, Self-employed).
Python & Data Science Libraries
Pandas, NumPy → data manipulation.
Scikit-learn → ML pipeline (training, scaling, prediction).
Pickle → model deployment/storage.
Model Deployment
Built an interactive Streamlit web app (app.py) for end-users.
Integrated ML model (model.pkl) and scaler into a real-time application.
Designed a user-friendly UI with custom CSS animations (approval/rejection messages).
Full-Stack Data Application Mindset
Combined backend ML logic with a frontend web interface.
Showed ability to turn a research model into a usable product.
✅ Soft / Industry-Ready Skills Demonstrated
Problem-Solving → Took a real-world domain (loan approvals) and solved it with ML.
Business Understanding → Mapped inputs like income, assets, CIBIL score to decision-making.
End-to-End Ownership → You handled everything: dataset → model → deployment → UI.
User Experience Focus → Added design elements, animations, and clear instructions for usability.
